# Final Project - Cafee

The client visits the cafe website and sees a list of menu sections and dishes corresponding to them. He can see information about the dish, find out what ingredients it consists of, how many calories, proteins, fats and carbohydrates it contains. The customer adds dishes to the cart and goes to the order page. He makes an order and chooses the date and time when to pick it up, as well as the type of payment - cash or card. The administrator is reviewing the order. When a customer comes to pick up an order, the administrator gives him loyalty points. If the client did not come for the order, the administrator can lower his loyalty points and block the client. The administrator manages the menu, blocks / unblocks clients, adds / removes administrators.
